                    <h4 className="alinea-title">The story</h4>
                    <p className="light alinea">
                        Excited friends came to me with questions about mechanical keyboards. I'm always in to help them find a keyboard
                        that suits them best. The second step is of course... a nice keycapset!
                    </p>

                    <p className="light alinea">
                        We were browsing through several vendors and other websites like Geekhack. At that moment the idea came to mind. One
                        website to rule them all. Just one website with an overview of keycapsets that are available or will be available
                        soon. See this site as a proxy to all the vendors out there.
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="alinea-title">The goal</h4>
                    <p className="light alinea">
                        The goal is to be a hub for keycapset related knowledge. This site should function as an overview of created sets
                        and can also act as an inspiration for new designs. KCS is a 1-stop-shop for information about current GBs and ICs.
                        Users are able to add keycapsets they like to their favorites and maintain an overview of what they want and/or own.
                        They'll be able to have a user profile to share and shill out their keycapsets. And in the future their complete
                        builds!
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="alinea-title">For set designers</h4>
                    <p className="light alinea">
                        I want to make it easier for you as a designer to express yourself. <br /> My goal is to make it possible for you to
                        have a single webpage with all the information you need. Such as vendors, renders, previews etc. <br />
                        Make it able to run your Interest Checks and have all analytical data you need to run a group buy in one place!
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="alinea-title">For explorers</h4>
                    <p className="light alinea">
                        This could be your go-to website to look for keycapsets. I want you to be able to search based on name, type or even
                        the color you like. I want to make it as easy as possible for you to decide what set you should go with on your next
                        build. <br />
                        You'll be able to add your favorite sets to collections and create a user profile very soon!
                    </p>

                        This site could be an advantage to your business. From both the overview and the page with the single set I'll proxy
                        the user to your shop!
